Producer-Consumer Pattern Implementation
Thread Synchronization and Concurrent Programming

Basic Producer-Consumer Demo
Source: integers 1-10
Buffer capacity: 3

Items transferred: 10
Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Elapsed: 0.0002s
Throughput: 61570.29 items/s

JSON Data Demo
Source: JSON-like event data

Items transferred: 3
  {'id': 1, 'event': 'login', 'user': 'alice'}
  {'id': 2, 'event': 'click', 'user': 'bob', 'target': '/home'}
  {'id': 3, 'event': 'logout', 'user': 'alice'}

Blocking Behavior Demo
Producer waits when buffer full
Consumer waits when buffer empty

Producer putting 0...
  Put 0 (buffer size: 1)
Producer putting 1...
  Put 1 (buffer size: 2)
Producer putting 2...
Consumer taking...
  Took 0 (buffer size: 1)
  Put 2 (buffer size: 2)
Producer putting 3...
Consumer taking...
  Took 1 (buffer size: 1)
  Put 3 (buffer size: 2)
Producer putting 4...
Consumer taking...
  Took 2 (buffer size: 1)
  Put 4 (buffer size: 2)
Consumer taking...
  Took 3 (buffer size: 1)
Consumer taking...
  Took 4 (buffer size: 0)
